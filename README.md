Question 1 : git repo has been sucessfully shared with the teacher

Question 2 : We've taken our past template of ERC721 with the three function _safemint x2 and _mint. Whitch makes our contract mintable.

Question 3 : We've implemented two things, a string name called SMBT and a uint256 counter that increment itslef every time the function _mint_ is called.
Having a global variable enables us to create a simple function that anyone ca call to get how many token have been created so far.

Question 4 : We have created a react app using npm and the library "create-react-app"

Question 5 :  To connect the react app to the block chain we have used web3.js. It allows us to connect to the blockchain ( locally here) and communicate with it. 

Question 6 : We have to call the public parameter 'name' of the contract with web3js and displayed it.
